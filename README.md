# How to learn a new programming language

Familiarize yourself with the language by solving problems.
Solve the Problems in a language your familiar with (first?).
Compare your solutions.

## 1. Learn the basics

Solve some [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, to learn about:

- Data structures
- Types
- Control flow
- How to interact with the file system

Take a look at other peoples solutions as well!

## 2. data structures, algorithms & patterns

### Data Structures

### Algorithms

- binary search
- quicksort
- Monte Carlo Tree Search

### Patterns

- Pub / Sub

## 4. Small Projects

### Websocket Server

Create a chat room client that takes connections.

- join + room(string)
- leave + room(string)
- message + room(string) + message(string)

Teaches you about:

- sockets
- native vs 3rd party libraries
- the module system
- async

### Async Request Queue

Create a queue that

- returns a promise.
- You have to hand it a promise factory.
- When they call the promise factory, your job gets to execute.
- The async request queue can only have up to 3 running jobs at a time.

### Basic HTTP Server

## 5. A large scale project

Choose a project that forces you to implement some patterns, eg:

- An interpreter
  - [Crafting interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/)
  - [Writing an interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)
- A rendering Framework
  - [Building an SSR framework using vite](https://zach.codes/building-an-ssr-framework-using-vite-prisma/)
  - [Daniel Roe: Building for the Edge - Crafting a Next-Gen Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdHLU0qHKhA)
